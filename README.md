Mancala Game with Alpha-Beta Pruning in Python


This project implements the Mancala game, a classic two-player board game, with an AI agent using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for efficient decision-making. The Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm, commonly used in two-player games. It helps the AI make better decisions faster by eliminating branches of the game tree that won't affect the final decision.
